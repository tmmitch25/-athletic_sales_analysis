# Athletic Sales Analysis

# Overview

In this project, I analyze athletic sales data to uncover insights that could help improve sales strategies. The focus is on cleaning the data, performing exploratory analysis, and visualizing the results to identify trends and patterns.

# Steps

This project involves a few main steps:

1. Data Cleaning: Ensuring the data is in a usable format and handling any missing or incorrect values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the data to look for trends or patterns.
3. Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to make the insights clearer.
4. Statistical Analysis: Running some basic statistical tests to support conclusions.

# Key Findings

- Sales Trends: I noticed certain months had higher sales, which could suggest seasonal patterns.
- Top Performers: Some product categories consistently performed better than others, suggesting areas for focused marketing.
- Regional Differences: There were noticeable differences in sales across regions, which might mean certain regions respond better to specific     
  products.

# Conclusion

Based on the analysis, Iâ€™ve identified areas for improvement, especially around focusing on high-performing categories and regions. This can help guide sales strategies moving forward.
